## Instructions

### Installation

1. Download the latest build from [releases page](https://github.com/doyaGu/BallanceModLoaderPlus/releases).
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location of your choice.
3. Copy all the extracted files to the root directory of your Ballance game installation. After that, you should find the following files in your Ballance directory:
   - `BMLPlus.dll` in the `BuildingBlocks` directory.
   - `ModLoader` directory.
4. Start the game by clicking on `Player.exe`.

### Uninstalling

Go to the Ballance root folder and delete `BMLPlus.dll` in the `BuildingBlocks` directory. If you would like to remove the entire data of BML (installed mods, maps, configs, etc.), delete the `ModLoader` folder as well.

## Troubleshooting

If your game crashes after installing BML+, or you encounter bugs while playing with BML+, please raise a new Issue on GitHub with the following information:

- Describe the condition you met in detail.
- Provide screenshots to help explain if possible.
